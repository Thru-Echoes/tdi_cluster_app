# Interactively predict JUST Company

**This is a web app I made for the Data Incubator semi-finalist challenge.** 


Tool for exploring the relationships between JUST companies and how JUST scores are calculated based on specific variables / predictors. 

## 1. Overview

#### 1.1 How to use this web tool?

All you need to do is open the file *index.html* in your favorite browser. I would prefer **Mozilla Firefox** for personal security and **Google Chrome** for slight increases in page loading speeds

*Note:* Slight is relative to this web tool - other projects with heavy Javascript computations may have major speed increases from Chrome vs. Firefox.

#### 1.2 A static web app

Due to potential concerns regarding backend (**e.g. server-side code + behavior relating to security**), this web tool runs without server-side support. Server-side functionality could be added in at the user- or administration-level if desired, but no current part of this web tool runs outside of standard *HTML, CSS, and Javascript* - all as static files directly in the browser.

## 2. Results of clustering algorithm

We used a clustering method - currently being development as **TSEClustering** by Oliver Muellerklein at UC Berkeley.
